Despite the current industry trend of moving away from jQuery, it is still used in a lot of legacy codebase and simple landing page sites. When working with those projects, it is important that you understand the syntax that once used by virtually all web developers. "Daisy chaining" in jQuery is the style that's been adapted by many other libraries such as d3 although directly manipulating DOM became the thing of the past with the modern frontend framework like React and Vue.
