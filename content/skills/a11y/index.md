The number 11 in A11y represents the number of letters between the beginning and the end of the word 'accessibility.' Beginning January 1, 2021, the Ontario Government requires all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 to meet WCAG 2.0 level AA other than criteria 1.2.4 (live caption) and 1.2.5 (pre-recorded audio descriptions). The fine for failing compliance can be up to $100,000 per day for repeat offenders.
