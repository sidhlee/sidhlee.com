Did the hooks kill Redux? Every time I encounter this question, there seems to be one more tweet about the new version of Redux Toolkit from Mark Erikson. Maybe it's true that mid-2019 was the worst time learning Redux because of React 16.8, but despite the infamous learning curve of Redux, I managed to create many apps that use Redux, along with countless to-do apps. I don't know when I'm going to use Redux again in my project, but I sure don't want to forget the technology I've spent so much time learning.
