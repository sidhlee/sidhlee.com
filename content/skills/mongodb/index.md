After finishing several tutorials and Udemy courses on building full-stack apps, I discovered MongoDB University that offers free in-depth studies on the MongoDB database. These are the courses I have completed:

- M001 MongoDB Basics
- M103 Basic Cluster Administration
- M121 The MongoDB Aggregation Framework
- M220JS: MongoDB for Javascript Developers
- M320: Data Modeling
