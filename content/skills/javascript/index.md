JavaScript is the fourth programming language that I've learned after Basic, C, and Python, and it is the language that got me truly excited about its limitless possibility. I think it's the same reason that made me choose my first career as a musician. It connects people. The code that you write travels with HTML and CSS all around the world allowing people to interact with your page creating unique experience for individual users.
