Gatsby is the React framework for building a "blazing-fast" static site with React. I've created several live websites with Gatsby, including my portfolio website (you're looking at it!) Gatsby's extensive ecosystem of plugins and templates can be its selling point. However, I've found sometimes it's a bit opinionated and leads to unexpected problems (and I'm still not so excited about writing graphql queries for images).
