CSS is what user can "see" and "feel" on your website. Just like how we feel the atmosphere once we step into a store or a restaurant, CSS is responsible for giving the user good first impression of our website and application. Because CSS is closely connected to how the user experiences our content, it is very important to follow the accessibility guidelines including proper color contrast and font size.
