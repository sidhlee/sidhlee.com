Jest is the testing framework developed by Facebook. I completed 'React Testing with Jest and Enzyme' Udemy course in 2020 which covered the following topics:

- Unit, integration and functional tests for React, Hooks, Contex and Redux using Jest and Enzyme.
- Tradeoffs for different testing approaches and when to choose which approach.
- Test Driven Development.
- Mock methods and modules to keep tests isolated.
