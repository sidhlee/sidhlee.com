Ever since Next.js started to support static site generation in 2020, it seems that now Next.js can do everything that Gatsby does, but not the other way around. After building several websites with Gatsby, I am currently working on converting some of my existing projects into Next.js application. So far, it feels like there's more flexibility, although many features, including the routing system, are similar.
