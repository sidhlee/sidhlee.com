It was April 2020 that I finally jumped on the TypeScript bandwagon and started taking Understanding TypeScript, a Udemy course by one of my favorite instructors, Max Schwarzmuller. After writing TypeScript for over a year now, I think it gives an excellent development experience, especially when you have mid to large-sized projects. You typically invest more time for setup upfront, but you usually end up saving many headaches and debugging sessions down the road.
